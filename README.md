1. The code can be compiled and executed by cygwin terminal on windows, make sure to include the gcc-fortran package when it asks for the list of packages to install
https://www.cygwin.com/install.html
2. After installing the package, open Settings -> System -> Advanced System Settings -> Advanced -> Environment Variables -> Edit the value of Path variable and add a new entry for C:\cygwin\bin OR C:\cygwin64\bin based on which version of cygwin was installed. After doing this you will be able to execute the executable files generated by fortran compiler just by double clicking on the executable.

MACOS
Install gfortran using brew
`brew install gfortran`
Make sure the version of gfortran is atleast 14.2.0 by running `gfortran --version`
If the version is less than the version above, run `brew upgrade gfortran`

EXECUTING THE CODE
After installing the prerequisites, navigate to the code directory and execute the following command to input the data, store it in a file and then execute the code
Windows: `gfortran PunchedIn.f90 -o punchedin.exe  && ./punchedin.exe && gfortran Punched.f90 -o punched.exe  && ./punched.exe`
MacOS: `gfortran PunchedIn.f90 -o punchedin  && ./punchedin && gfortran Punched.f90 -o punched  && ./punched`

To execute the code without changing the input, use the following command
Windows: `gfortran Punched.f90 -o punched.exe  && ./punched.exe`
MacOS: `gfortran Punched.f90 -o punched  && ./punched`
OR 
Execute the punchedin.exe and then punched.exe from the code path
